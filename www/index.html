<strong>Day 09: The ISRO dials the stars</strong>
9 p.m. (IST), April 3rd, 2020
</p>

<p>
On last night's show Prof. Martin John Rees, British cosmologist and astrophysicist encouraged young scientists to study and create new observations, new theories and new techniques. He shared ideas around his work on cosmic radiation and extreme phenomena in the cosmos, how this century is special as humans have more control than before yet no astronomer believes that we are at the end point. Future evolution is beyond humans.
</p>

<p>
We discussed science fiction writing and how sci-fi is stimulating for its ideas -first rate sci fi better than 2nd rate science. In the light of this current pandemic he emphasised that we need to prepare better to
preserve freedom, privacy and security for our future, and understand that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable. As this situation has accentuated social disparity, he hopes it will lead to a political change towards creating a new social order in which we are sensitive to our environment. And finally, how both science and art are ever expanding and open ended, and how the ideas of science can be appreciated just as you can appreciate a piece of music.
</p>

<p>
Tonight's music is easy, relaxed and quiet. All suggestions welcome.
</p>

</p>

        Gayatri Gajare has created this 3-minute piece that is composed of a constant binaural compilation in the background, backed with a slow beat. The binaural beats used are Alpha, Theta and Gamma ones. The composition includes natural sounds juxtaposed with technological ones and slowly recedes back into single binaural tones.

        Radha is making sound tracks with low frequency sounds and subliminal audios to induce sleep in her listeners. As we move into a society where time is of more and more essence, this sound track is a reminder to the listener to stop and rest.
