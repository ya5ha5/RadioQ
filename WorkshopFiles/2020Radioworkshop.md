**About this workshop**

In the month of August you will run the Radio Quarantine Station. 

Radio Quarantine ran during the first half of the lockdown in March 2020. During its brief existence, we interviewed scientists, artists, activists and historians, besides also running a regular program of music from around the world. 
More information here: [ArtScienceBLR Radio Station](http://radio.artscienceblr.org/)

You will conceive programs, develop and run the radio station. Your responsibilities will include producing programs, interviewing guests and curating shows. You will learn and experience how to develop shows, produce content and execute the show.

You will need basic knowledge of Audio Software and Digital Audio Workstations.

There will also be Masterclasses by visiting experts.

## Daily Reflection & Summary


### **RADIO Q DAY01  Monday 17/08/2020** 


**Sudhansu Rai**

Today was a meet and greet session. Everybody got to know each other. We had a small little discussion about how each one of us was feeling. some of us were frustrated with the lockdown and others were happy and inspired.
Some insightful talks on How developing local awareness leads to real development of a society and what role Open Source softwares have in it. Making knowledge, services and products Affordable, Available an Accessible to massesis the main goal of Open source softwares. We also understood how Radio is a great way of making technology and growing conciousness for it, accessible and affordable for the needy, cuz in the end everything we uses Radio Waves as a medium of communication. Communication is the key to development.

## Thoughts on the Class and the Upcoming Podcast

**Archit Joshua Balraj**

The last two classes have been extremely informative. The talks from the faculty have been very illuminating regarding radio today and its history. In making the masterclass, I became more aware of pacing and content. I discovered pirate radio. I enjoyed learning the influence of blues to rock and roll and what is modern pop music today.

For our radio program I think we can broadcast music from local bands to improve exposure which is sorely lacking in all fm stations we tune in to today. I think we can promote students from srishti and other colleges who are singer/songwriters with live performance. I think this concept will attract listeners from a young collge crowd who to genrate a scene for that kind of sound. 

**Stuti Sen**

I hadn’t previously considered radio as something particularly important. Growing up it was a source of entertainment in cars, a place to find new music; a comforting presence, if one taken for granted. It’s been interesting to find that everything since then that we have used to replace and improve it still comes from it; the Bluetooth connection I use to play music in cars now, podcasts and playlists on Spotify, literally everything with access to a wifi connection; its effects on education and culture as well are historical and awe-inspiring. So much can be done with radio, and so much has been. One of the most interesting things I learnt from one of our sessions is the fact that one can learn so much about the culture in different parts of the world by simply tuning into a radio frequency in their area (which is possibly made even easier now with online radio).  It’s thrilling to imagine the connections created worldwide; stories, music and knowledge shared between strangers from strange places. It makes the rest of humanity feel a little more accessible, a little more relatable.

For the content for my radio show, I wanted to discuss various different mental health disorders- what they are, how they present themselves (and how differently they can present themselves), and misconceptions regarding them. Pretty frequently I find that movies and television shows use mental health disorders in their content, and tend to misrepresent them in order to create “horror” or “thriller” themes, with little to no regard for how people watching can tend to take it as true information. For someone who has to deal with a mental disorder, having to deal with people’s skewed expectations of it as well must be distressing. So additionally, I wanted to find content (movies, shows, music, etc.) that accurately represent and emulate what it is like to be a person suffering from a specific mental health disorder; and considering I wouldn’t be able to share the content because of licensing issues, I wanted to discuss what makes them appropriate and affective. It’s such a huge thing to feel represented and understood, and it can be a matter of great comfort and relief to learn that there are others out there like us, be it through stories or music.

**SUDHANSHU RAI**

Radio is something I've grown up with. I used to have a Philips Radio cum casette player which I used to like a lot and even after having a lot of advanced gadgets around me it has influenced my life since childhood. Being an early 20th century kid, I have grown up listening to stories of Jataka Tales and Panchatantra on my casette player to grooving on my favourite top international hits on my Radio. Even after having devices like a smartphone which has the whole world in it, Radio is something I miss a lot today. Listening to the voices and curated playlists of some iconic RJ's like Ameen Sayani on a low quality+static audio is something difficult to find in this generation of High Res Audio of Spotify app.
Now, adding to this, Radio is present in every device which has wireless medium of transmission. Radio has been more than just a peice of constantly eveolving technology. It was a status symbol, a symbol of auditory culture which has moved generations till it's value started reducing amongst its consumers. Radio has led to the development of several naotable products like I-Pod, Apple Music, Spotify and guess what we have forgotten Radio itself in this process of evolution over the years.

I would like to propose the idea of having a radio drama which will be based on the life of a Traditional Artisan from a community. A storyline which starts from his normal happy everyday life before lockdown, followed by a series of events during pandemic which has brought his/her life to an end where he/she is experiencing loss of everything.  

**Atharva Rane**
My only connection to radio was the car radio and the one my parents would play in the morning. I never really used radio. But the story behind radio got me interested. I never knew setting wifi netwoks and teaching could be done in this manner.

For project I want to do something with audio editing. I am interested in audio production and have tried a little bit before so I want to learn more of that. I looked at repeer and tried it a little. I want to try and make a composition if not a fully proper song using sounds around me.

**Tanay Ashutosh Sathe**
Radio to me is bits of chatter with a whole heap of songs thrown into the mix. Usually tha stuff that the car's radio played while driving, unless it was replaced with some prerecorded songs. Now it  is replaced with wi-fi and Bluetooth and data networks. Or what was taugth in physics class, and the tests with trick questions. And the nights I spent preparing for the finals, only to start forgetting the important bits in the equation.

My proposal is to have a radio program that broadcasts common everyday gossip. Nothing too political. Something that bored housewives depicted in storybooks would do to while away their time. Humans are social animals. Humans that lack interaction soon start to display mental and physical health problems. This is aimed at the people who suffer from a lack of human interaction, it will act like a balm that sooths the pain of loneliness and maybe even heal it.
