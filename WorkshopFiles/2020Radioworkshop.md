**About this workshop**

In the month of August you will run the Radio Quarantine Station. 

Radio Quarantine ran during the first half of the lockdown in March 2020. During its brief existence, we interviewed scientists, artists, activists and historians, besides also running a regular program of music from around the world. 
More information here: [ArtScienceBLR Radio Station](http://radio.artscienceblr.org/)

You will conceive programs, develop and run the radio station. Your responsibilities will include producing programs, interviewing guests and curating shows. You will learn and experience how to develop shows, produce content and execute the show.

You will need basic knowledge of Audio Software and Digital Audio Workstations.

There will also be Masterclasses by visiting experts.
